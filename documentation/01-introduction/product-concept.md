## Business Model

BellyBox operates on a **commission-based revenue model**:

1. **Consumer Payments**: Customers pay per-meal prices that include:
   - Vendor base price (set by vendor)
   - Delivery fee (platform fee, zone-specific)
   - Platform commission (percentage of vendor base price)

2. **Vendor Payouts**: Vendors receive their base price minus commission (commission is only on base price, not delivery fee)

3. **Rider Payments**: Riders receive per-delivery fees plus zone bonuses

4. **Platform Revenue**: Commission on vendor base prices + delivery fees

**Example Pricing Calculation:**
- Vendor base price: ₹60/meal
- Delivery fee: ₹15/meal
- Commission: 15% of base = ₹9/meal
- **Customer pays**: ₹60 + ₹15 + ₹9 = ₹84/meal
- **Vendor receives**: ₹60 - ₹9 = ₹51/meal
- **Platform revenue**: ₹9 (commission) + ₹15 (delivery fee) = ₹24/meal
